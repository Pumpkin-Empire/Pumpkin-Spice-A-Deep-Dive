# Pumpkin-Spice-A-Deep-Dive

## Current Plan

1. Research twitter apis to find out what data is available.
   - Location
    - Date
    - Tweet
    - Demographic
    - Reactions 
    - Retweets
2. Save data to SQL database or nosql?
3. Set up api pulls to pull data (is it REST? Can do postman or something else)
4. Investigate initial data.
    - Make initial data plan (basic analysis)
    - Plan & timeline for additional data analysis/buildout  based on available data & time available
5. Set up docker/airflow and spark to do scheduled pulls of data
6. Analyze data and make presentable project (jupyter notebook, powerpoint presentation or other? I.e. interactive app if time)
7. Additional buildout based on time

**Avenues of analysis**
  - Word map
  - Businesses mentioned
  - Frequency throughout day
  - Frequency day after day
  - Sentiment analysis over time
  - Demographics of the tweeter
  - Location of tweeter/tweet
